CO2 Emission Ratings Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains the implementation and supporting materials for the research paper "CO2 Emission Ratings Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms" published in IEEE Xplore. The paper explores the use of supervised learning techniques to predict CO2 emission ratings of vehicles based on their specifications, providing insights into eco-friendly decision-making.

ðŸ“œ Abstract
The increasing concern about environmental sustainability has made CO2 emissions a critical parameter for vehicle evaluation. This research utilizes supervised machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict CO2 emission ratings based on vehicle data such as engine size, fuel consumption, and other specifications. Various algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Linear Regression, were evaluated for their accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability.

The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between vehicle attributes and CO2 emissions, helping policymakers, manufacturers, and consumers make informed decisions to mitigate environmental impact.
